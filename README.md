The Hat is a simple "Jumpman" like game that was made for BGMC 30. (Though it was completed far to late to enter)

Your Goal: Collect all the round yellow monsters and put them back in your magic hat.
The game has both Keyboard and Gamepad controls. It contains 5 levels each with its own challenges.



Known Issues: Sometimes, when completing a jump and immediatly jumping again, the character will die.
